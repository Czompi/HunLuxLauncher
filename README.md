# HunLuxLauncher
Minecraft Launcher for macOS and Windows.

Both platforms are use the same sources for download datas from our servers and they also requires official Minecraft.net account to work.

We will not provide the back-end sources for this launcher yet, because we need to improve it and we don't want to loose all control over our system.

Some parts of this launcher is shared only with dll-s, that are protected with special tool to make decrypting our full launcher harder.

These packages are related to Mojang's authserver and communicating with our back-end.

You still could tinker it based on functions and its responses to build your own dlls based on these informations.
